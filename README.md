VectorClass is an algorithm that implements a Vector class in C#, with its properties and operations. A vector is a geometric object that has a magnitude and a direction, and can be used to represent physical quantities, such as displacement, velocity, force, etc. The Vector class has two properties: X and Y, which store the horizontal and vertical components of the vector. The Vector class also has a property called Angle, which returns the angle of the vector with respect to the positive x-axis. The Vector class supports several operations, such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product, which are defined by the operator overloading feature of C#. The algorithm also includes a static method called AngleVector, which returns the angle between two vectors.

The algorithm is written in C#, an object-oriented and cross-platform programming language. To run the algorithm, you need to have the .NET Framework or the .NET Core installed on your system. Moreover, you need to have an IDE or a text editor that supports the C# language, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop.

To use the algorithm, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the GitHub repository of the project.
- Open the file Program.cs with your IDE or text editor.
- Compile and run the code.
- Create two Vector objects with the desired values for X and Y.
- Perform the desired operations on the Vector objects, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dotting them.
- Print the results of the operations, such as the new Vector object, the scalar value, or the angle.

The algorithm is distributed under the MIT license, which allows the use, modification and distribution of the code to anyone, as long as the same license is maintained and the authorship of the original author is recognized. The algorithm is based on the concept of vectors, which is a fundamental topic in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
