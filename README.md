VectorClass is an algorithm that implements a Vector class in C#, with its properties and operations. A vector is a geometric object that has a magnitude and a direction, and can be used to represent physical quantities, such as displacement, velocity, force, etc. The Vector class has two properties: X and Y, which store the horizontal and vertical components of the vector. The Vector class also has a property called Angle, which returns the angle of the vector with respect to the positive x-axis. The Vector class supports several operations, such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product, which are defined by the operator overloading feature of C#. The algorithm also includes a static method called AngleVector, which returns the angle between two vectors.
